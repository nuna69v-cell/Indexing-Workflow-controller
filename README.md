## 🚀 Getting Started

There are two main ways to get started with GenX FX, depending on your goals.

### For Traders: Using a Pre-Built Expert Advisor

This is the fastest and easiest way to start trading, especially with the specialized Gold Master EA.

1.  **Download the EA**:
    -   Navigate to the `expert-advisors/` directory.
    -   Download the `GenX_Gold_Master_EA.mq4` file.

2.  **Install in MetaTrader 4**:
    -   Open your MT4 terminal.
    -   Go to `File > Open Data Folder`.
    -   Navigate to the `MQL4/Experts/` directory.
    -   Copy the downloaded `.mq4` file into this directory.

3.  **Configure and Run**:
    -   Restart MT4 or refresh the "Expert Advisors" list in the Navigator panel.
    -   Drag the "GenX\_Gold\_Master\_EA" onto a chart (e.g., XAUUSD).
    -   Configure the settings as described in the [Gold Master EA Guide](GOLD_MASTER_EA_GUIDE.md).
    -   Enable "AutoTrading" on your MT4 terminal and start trading.

### For Developers: Full System Setup

This option allows you to run the entire backend, API, and AI models for development and customization.

1.  **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Mouy-leng/GenX_FX.git
    cd GenX_FX
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies**:
    The project uses both Python and Node.js.
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Set Up Environment Variables**:
    -   Copy the `.env.example` file to a new file named `.env`.
    -   Fill in the required API keys and configuration details for the services you plan to use (e.g., FXCM, Gemini, etc.). See the [API Key Setup Guide](API_KEY_SETUP.md) for more details.

4.  **Initialize the System**:
    Use the unified CLI to initialize the system, which will create necessary directories and default configurations.
    ```bash
    python genx_cli.py init
    ```

5.  **Run the System**:
    The platform includes a concurrent runner for the frontend and backend services.
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    This command will start the FastAPI backend and the React frontend simultaneously. You can then access the platform at `http://localhost:3000`.
